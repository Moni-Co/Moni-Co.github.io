                <h2>Our commitment: protecting your personal data.</h2>

                <p>
                    We collect and process personal information when you use the Monico app or site. We value
                    your ability to control the data you share to us. This Privacy Policy tells you how we
                    collect, store, process and protect your personal data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy considers the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (R.A. 10173), the EU General Data
                    Protection Regulation (GDPR), their Implementing Rules and Regulations, and the laws of the
                    Philippines and Singapore.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Personal Information is any information that can be used to identify, distinguish, or contact
                    you. This includes your name, phone number, email address, billing information, ID number,
                    device model, location, or other data that is specific to you.
                </p>

                <h2>Who is covered by this Privacy Policy?</h2>

                <p>
                    If you visit a site running services provided by Monico, or download and install the Monico
                    app, this Privacy Policy applies to you.
                </p>

                <h2>Why do we collect Personal Information?</h2>

                <p>
                    We want to make sure you can safely and legally use our platform. We use the personal information
                    we collect to give you a secure, efficient, and bespoke experience. When necessary, relevant, and
                    reasonable, we may collect, use, process, and look at your personal information to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Prevent potentially illegal or prohibited activities like fraud and abuse;</li>
                    <li>Process transactions;</li>
                    <li>Send you notices about your transactions;</li>
                    <li>Collect fees;</li>
                    <li>Fix technical issues and security risks;</li>
                    <li>Filter offers based on your citizenship and/or location;</li>
                    <li>Check information for accuracy, and verify that with third parties;</li>
                    <li>Notify you about changes in the service;</li>
                    <li>Customize and personalize your experience in the app and website;</li>
                    <li>Measure how you use our app and website, and optimize product design.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We’ll ask for your consent before using your Personal Information in a way that isn’t covered by
                    this Privacy Policy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we can, we aggregate and anonymize information. We remove any personally identifiable information
                    and present data as categories. We do this so that you are never identified as an individual. Any
                    information processed in this way is not considered personal information.
                </p>

                <h2>What Personal Information is collected and for what purpose?</h2>
                <h3>Analytics information when you use our services</h3>

                <p>
                    Whenever you visit the Monico website, use the Monico app, or use Monico services on another app or
                    website, we collect information sent to us by the device you use to access our platform. This may
                    include your IP address, device information (for example, the device name and type, operating system,
                    system language, and browser type,) location, and pages you accessed on our website. We use this
                    information to improve and optimize your experience based on what device you have and where you are
                    located. We may also use your information to filter token offers displayed to you based on your
                    geographic location.
                </p>

                <h3>Contact information when you contact us for assistance</h3>

                <p>
                    On the Monico app and website you have the opportunity to ask us questions through the email form,
                    chat, and other contact methods provided. We may ask for your contact information (e.g. name, email
                    address, phone number, location, etc.) when you get in touch with us. We use this information only
                    in connection to answering your query.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you receive emails from us, we may use analytics tools to capture data about when the email is
                    opened or when a link in the email is clicked. This data helps us measure how effective our
                    communications and marketing campaigns are.
                </p>

                <h3>Personal information to verify your Monico account</h3>

                <p>
                    When you run the Monico app after a new installation, or when you run the app after clearing app
                    data, we generate a unique and random device ID associated to your device on our server. This device
                    ID is used to identify you on all transactions on the Monico app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before allowing you to make transactions on Monico, we may require you to provide additional personal
                    information. This information is used to verify your identity or manage risk. If you choose to verify
                    your account, we may ask for your name, phone number, email address, Facebook and Linkedin profile URLs,
                    home address, citizenship, and identification card images. As detailed in this Privacy Policy, your
                    information will only be used to facilitate, verify, and secure your transactions, or provide you with
                    other services you have signed up for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We may ask you to provide us access to personal information stored on other third parties (for example,
                    Facebook, Linkedin, and Twitter.) We will only have access to information you choose to provide from
                    those platforms based on the privacy settings you set. By associating an account managed by a third
                    party with your Monico account, and by authorizing Monico to access your personal information on that
                    account, you agree that Monico may collect, store, and use your information according to this Privacy
                    Policy.
                </p>

                <h3>Activity details when you transact on Monico</h3>

                <p>
                    When you buy or sell on Monico, or perform other activities on our platform, we may collect information
                    about your transactions. This information includes time and date of the transaction, your name, IP
                    address of your device, sender and receiver cryptocurrency wallet public addresses, and transaction
                    amounts. This is in accordance with our fraud prevention and anti-money laundering measures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We may also collect information about how you use and interact with the Monico app or website to
                    prevent, identify, or mitigate malicious or suspicious behavior. For example, we may look at connection
                    logs for indications of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. We may also evaluate your access
                    devices for any indication of malicious software that may affect your security on the Monico platform
                    or the availability of Monico services.
                </p>

                <h2>How we share your Private Information</h2>

                <p>
                    We use several trusted third-party service providers for certain data processing, data storage, data
                    analysis, and fraud prevention tasks. We use these service providers based on their high data protection
                    and security standards. We only share to them information that is required to perform their service.
                    Any information shared with them is treated confidentially and used only to facilitate your transaction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We may share personal information with partner financial institutions that require information about
                    you and your transactions when using their services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We may share your personal information with law enforcement agencies, government agencies and/or
                    officials, or other third parties. We will do this when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court
                    order, or a similar court procedure. We may also disclose your personal information if we believe in
                    good faith that disclosure is necessary to prevent financial or physical harm.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other companies may sign up for our service and perform token sales on our platform. If you participate
                    in a token sale, we may share your personal information with these companies to facilitate the
                    transaction, send announcements about the company’s token sale, and comply with Know-Your-Customer
                    (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules that the company is subject to. These companies are not
                    allowed to use this information for any purpose without your express consent. Please note that companies
                    will have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, and Monico cannot be held responsible for
                    their operations, including but not limited to, their information practices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We will only share your
                    information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. We will only share your personal
                    information for purposes beyond what is described in this Privacy Policy with your explicit consent. If
                    there is an actionable breach of your personal information, we will notify you within seventy-two (72)
                    hours.
                </p>

                <h2>How we secure your private information</h2>

                <p>
                    Your private information is processed by Monico, a platform built by Sterling Openovate Corporation
                    (doing business as Sterling Tech) in the Philippines. We store and process your personal information in
                    cloud servers and computers located in the Philippines, Singapore, the United States, and elsewhere in
                    the world where Monico and its service providers are located.

                    Your personal data is protected with a mix of electronic, physical, and procedural safeguards. Your
                    private keys are stored exclusively on your access devices. Our servers use firewalls, data encryption,

                    policies regularly to ensure protection of your data. We enforce physical security controls to our
                    premises and files. Access to your personal information is restricted to personnel that require it in

                    Certain rights are provided to you under the law. These include the right to access your data, to

                    that we store about you in behalf of another party. Your Monico account also allows you to review your
                    personal information. You can visit the “Profile” tab on the Monico app to view and edit your personal
